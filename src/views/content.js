        about_project: `Alpha zero is the game bot which plays Tic-Tac-Toe game. A goal of the bot is to beat humans in Tic-Tac-Toe. I choose Tic-Tac-Toe game because of limitation of CPU power. Alpha-zero bot applies to almost all board games like Chess, Go and count four etc. 
                        <br><br> This game environment has 5 rows, 5 columns. To win this game player has to match 4 "O"s and 4 "X"s. It makes this game more difficult than normal Tic-Tac-Toe.
                        <br><br> During training alpha zero modal, Algorithm generates its dataset during run time base on the Monte Carlo tree search and policy evaluation. Also, for the support of web applications. I make rest API in a flask which takes Tic-Tac-Toe as input state and last player turn as input and return new action which contains the position of "X" or "O"..
